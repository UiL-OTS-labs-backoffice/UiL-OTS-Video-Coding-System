# UiL OTS Video Coding System
The UiL OTS Video Coding System is a piece of software for coding videos created in the UiL OTS Baby Lab, or in experiments with a similar setup. The software can be used to code looks of participants for each of the trials in the experiment. For each trial, the total look time is calculated, which can then be exported to a csv file.

## Type of experiment
This software is specifically made for researchers of the UiL OTS using a setup like in the babylab. This software does not allow for much more than is required by those experimenters, but exactly this makes it simple to use for the purposes for which it was made. 
In the babylab of the UiL OTS Lab, participants are usually presented with 8 trials in which stimuli have the form of sound or light from either the left or the right, or right in front of the participant. The participant is recorded and this recording gets an overlay, showing the trials and stimuli. 
Every time the participant looks at the source of the stimulus, a new look can be registered within that trial. The total look time for each trial is then calculated automatically and can later be saved to a csv.
The amount of trials and looks it not set, so any amount can be used, but before registering a look, a trial has to be made in the file.

## Features
* Supports multiple video formats
* Add any number of trials
* Add any number of looks in any trial
* Automatically check for timeouts
* Add comments to trials and looks
* Add research meta information about researcher, participant, etc
* Use quickeys for easy navigation
* Frame-by-frame step-through (also backwards possible)
* Exports to csv
* Projects can be saved for later continuation

## Requires:
 * [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
 * [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) 1.6 or later
